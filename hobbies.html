          <p>Growing up, I was always very involved in sports. Through high school, I played football, basketball and baseball. I also enjoyed pickup hockey with my friends at the local rink.</p>
          <p>After high school, I played football collegiately at Alma College. After repeated concussions, I made the difficult decision to be done with football.</p>
          <p>Today, I'm still a very active person. I lift weights almost daily and I enjoy golf, softball and basketball.</p>
